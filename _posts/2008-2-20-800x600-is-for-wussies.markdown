Yea that's right i said it, for wussies!  I checked my Google Analytics and noticed that the smallest resolution used to view the site was 1024x768, therefore i took a few minutes to expand the layout by 130 pixels.  This enables the longer code segments to fit inside of the images that contain them; I also find it much easier to read.  That is all for now...
