title: My first open source accepted patch!
---
Call me a loser, but I just hopped on the open source committing bandwagon.  I recently started using merb 0.9.x for a new project and there were a few things that I were off, so I used the awesome <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, cloned the projects i needed to tweak and went to town.  My first official commit was a small tweak to merb-core that correctly took in a custom configured session_id_key and you can see it <a href="http://github.com/wycats/merb-core/commit/b3fa33a6e565fcbbca03b64b8ff2d066a9ec60c4">here</a> :)
