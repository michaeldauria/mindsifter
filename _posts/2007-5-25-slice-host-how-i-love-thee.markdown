title: Slice Host, how I love thee
---

Anyway, I was speaking with Brendan about my current host at the time, Hostik (whom I do not recommend at all), and how expensive it was.  I had a dedicated server to run about a handful of sites that saw very little traffic.  I have "cacti":http://cacti.org running at all times and noticed that the server usage was pretty minimal and I was basically throwing money out.  This is when Brendan brought up his host, "Slice Host":http://slicehost.com.  I love these guys, quick to answer all of your questions in an email or a forum and their prices are just, well great.  I currently use 2 of their slices, one 256MB and a 512MB and it costs me half of what 1 dedicated server cost me.  Now that's amazing!  It gets better though, I have a pretty drastic performance boost from moving to the slice, which makes me very happy.

"Slice Host":http://slicehost.com, thank you for being a great host with great service and great prices.
