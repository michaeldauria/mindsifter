title: I suck at blogging
---
I told myself that once i started this thing that I would actually use it, looks like I was totally wrong.

I found it difficult at times to come up with something smart to say and toss it on here.  I want to use this blog as a tool to increase my writing abilities as well as give some people interesting topics to read over.  So I guess what I am saying is that I am going to write about everything whenever it dawns on me.  The way I see it is, no one is reading this thing anyway...
